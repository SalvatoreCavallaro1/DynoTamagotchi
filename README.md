# DynoTamagotchi
Development of a Tamagotchi for a special project of the Computer architecturer course at Politecnico di Torino, Academic year 2022-2023

The Dynosaur Tamagochi developed on the LandTiger with NXP LPC1768 on board gives the possibility for the user to feed the dinosaur with snacks and cuddle it using the touch screen to increase its happiness or to feed it with a meal to increase its satiety. When either parameter reaches zero, the dinosaur “abandons” the user, who has the option of reset the game and restart it from the beginning. There are present sounds for selection clicks made via joystick and for each action of the dinosaur, one also has the possibility of adjusting the volume via the potentiometer.
